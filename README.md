#CTestArena
This is simply a toy C project with which to refresh my memory of how to use the C language.

A few of the techniques I want to explore in this project:
* pulling in and linking the SDL framework/library
* expressing code in clearly defined modules with opaque types where appropriate
* explore the interplay between xcode projects and workspaces
* play with unit-testing
* building linked libraries as static libraries and as frameworks (to limit public header exposure)
